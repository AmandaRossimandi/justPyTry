# justPyTry
JustPy is an object-oriented, component based, high-level Python Web Framework that requires no front-end programming. I created a few sample by using it. For more details: https://justpy.io/

First:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

Then you can run "python apiTry.py" or "python rotateImg.py".
